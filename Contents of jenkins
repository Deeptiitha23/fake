The given Jenkins pipeline is designed to automate the process of infrastructure provisioning and configuration management using Terraform and Ansible. Here's a detailed breakdown of each part:

### Pipeline Structure and Stages

1. **Pipeline Declaration and Environment Variables:**
    ```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any

        environment {
            TERRAFORM_DIR = "${WORKSPACE}/terraform"
            ANSIBLE_DIR = "${WORKSPACE}/ansible"
            TERRAFORM_REPO = "https://github.com/Deeptiitha23/jenkins.git"
            ANSIBLE_REPO = "https://github.com/Deeptiitha23/jenkins.git"
        }
    }
    ```
    - `agent any`: This indicates that the pipeline can run on any available Jenkins agent.
    - `environment`: This section defines environment variables used throughout the pipeline. These include directories for Terraform and Ansible code and URLs for their respective repositories.

2. **Stages:**
    The pipeline is broken down into four main stages:

    #### 1. Clone Repositories
    ```groovy
    stage('Clone Repositories') {
        steps {
            dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                git branch: 'main', url: TERRAFORM_REPO
            }
            dir(ANSIBLE_DIR) {
                git branch: 'main', url: ANSIBLE_REPO
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - This stage clones the specified branches of the Terraform and Ansible repositories into their respective directories.

    #### 2. Terraform Apply
    ```groovy
    stage('Terraform Apply') {
        steps {
            script {
                dir(TERRAFORM_DIR) {
                    sh 'terraform init'
                    sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - Initializes Terraform and applies the configuration to provision the infrastructure. The `-auto-approve` flag automatically approves the plan without manual intervention.

    #### 3. Update Ansible Inventory
    ```groovy
    stage('Update Ansible Inventory') {
        steps {
            script {
                def privateIps = sh(script: "cd ${TERRAFORM_DIR} && terraform output -json private_ips", returnStdout: true).trim()
                echo "Private IPs: $privateIps"
                def ips = readJSON text: privateIps
                echo "Parsed IPs: $ips"
                generateInventory(ips)
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - Captures the output of Terraform (specifically, the private IPs of the created infrastructure).
    - Parses the JSON output to extract IP addresses.
    - Calls the `generateInventory` function to create an Ansible inventory file using the extracted IP addresses.

    #### 4. Run Ansible Playbook
    ```groovy
    stage('Run Ansible Playbook') {
        steps {
            script {
                dir(ANSIBLE_DIR) {
                    sh 'ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - Runs the Ansible playbook using the generated inventory file to configure the provisioned infrastructure.

### Helper Function: generateInventory

This function creates an Ansible inventory file based on the IP addresses provided by Terraform.
```groovy
def generateInventory(privateIps) {
    def inventoryContent = """
        [master]
        master ansible_host=${privateIps.master ?: ''} ansible_user=ubuntu
        
        [worker]
        worker ansible_host=${privateIps.worker ?: ''} ansible_user=ubuntu
        
        [all:vars]
        ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
    """
    writeFile file: "${ANSIBLE_DIR}/inventory.ini", text: inventoryContent
}
```
- Constructs the inventory content as a string with the master and worker nodes and their respective IP addresses.
- Writes this content to `inventory.ini` in the Ansible directory.

### Key Points and Considerations:

- **Environment Variables:** These simplify the pipeline by avoiding hard-coded values and enabling easy updates to repository URLs or working directories.
- **Stage Isolation:** Each stage has a distinct purpose, making the pipeline modular and easy to maintain.
- **Error Handling:** Consider adding error handling to manage failures gracefully, especially for stages like `Terraform Apply` and `Run Ansible Playbook`.
- **Security:** Ensure sensitive data such as repository credentials are managed securely, possibly using Jenkins credentials management.
- **Scalability:** The pipeline can be extended to include more stages or tasks as needed, such as running tests post-deployment or integrating with monitoring tools.

This structure is suitable for continuous deployment scenarios where infrastructure and application configurations need to be applied consistently and repeatedly.
